## Getting Started
To run the analysis locally, clone this repository and install the dependencies.

## Data Sources
The Netflix data used in this project was sourced from Almabetter.

## File Descriptions
- Netflix_Movies_and_TV_Shows_Clustering.ipynb : Colab notebook containing the exploratory data analysis.
- NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS CLUSTERING.csv : Folder containing the raw and processed datasets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In the Netflix_Movies_and_TV_Shows_Clustering.ipynb  notebook, we explored the following aspects of the Netflix data:
- Data Visualization, Storytelling & Experimenting with Charts.
- Distribution of Content ratings and durations of different Movies and TV Shows.
- Correlation between relevant numerical variables.

## Clustering
